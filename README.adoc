:toc: preamble

> Currently in concept phase, development just starting. Will include modules and functions for routine data science projects.

## TODO
- Write actual content!
- Check if https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/[import for tests] works
- Create and upload https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/[package] (automate with GitHub action?)
- Adapt https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-using-setup-py/[setup.py]
