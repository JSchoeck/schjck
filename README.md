# Personal Data Science Toolkit by [schjck](http://johannes.schoeck.org)
> Currently in concept phase, development just starting. Will include modules and functions for routine data science projects.

## TODO
- Write actual content!
- Check if [import for tests](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/) works
- Create and upload [package](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) (automate with GitHub action?)
- Adapt [setup.py](https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-using-setup-py/)

### Inspiration
- [Phyton Module Strcture](https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-using-setup-py/)
- [alex franz](https://alexfranz.com/posts/personal-python-data-science-toolkit-part-1/)
